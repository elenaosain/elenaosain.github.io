    <article>
      <section>
        <div class="durab"> <p> Shared data is showing that most EV (electrical vehicles), especially Model S (Tesla), owners are experiencing loss of about 5 percent battery capacity in the first 50,000 miles driven. Degradation is slowing down after 50,000 miles and it may take well over 100,000 miles of driving to see an additional 5% in the battery's degradation. The trend line coming from Tesla Forum members suggests that the average battery pack could go another 150,000 miles (200,000 miles maximum) before coming close to 90% capacity. A company <!--Electrek--> studied the data and found what it considered to be consistent patterns for these Tesla owners. Reaching a 90% charge level appears to be the ideal daily charge. As cited by a company, CEO Elon Musk once referred to a battery pack Tesla was testing in a lab with a simulated 500,000 miles driven. Musk said that the battery pack was still operating at over 80% of its original capacity. Keeping speculation to a minimum, what can be said is <em>durability</em> is looking good so far for electric cars battery packs. As well as that, another significant progress for the electric cars's batteries would have to be the fact that a group of Chinesse engeneers have created the ideal battery: the battery which charges in the same amount of time as you spend to fill your car with gasoline.

    <h4 class="onlylist"> 2.Safety</h4>
    <article>
      <section>
        <div class="safe" ><p> <em>Safety</em> is another reason why electric cars are more preferable. There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. So, according to the statistics, electric cars <em>are</em> safer.</p></div>

    <h4 class="onlylist"> 3.Cost</h4>
    <article>
      <section>
        <div class="cost"> <p>The <em>maintenance cost</em> of electric cars is lower than the one of those fueled by conventional gasoline. Fuel prices heavily depend on the political and military situation in countries providing oil;  one year of driving a gasoline car would cost you about $2,100 (given you drive about 15,000 miles per year, use one gallon of gas for each 25 miles traveled, and buy gasoline at $3.50 per gallon). At the same time, driving an electric car would cost you only $475 per year. Along with the fuel costs, conventional cars require regular technical inspections or transmission repairs. By all means, electric cars are a much cheaper alternative for those who want to save money.  it's extremely costly to have a car, nowadays, because there's always a part that's not working well and you have to take it to the service.</p></div>

        <p> Our project implies a governmental participation, the state giving you money in order to encourage you, as a citizen, to convert to a cleaner, not polluting energy. Therefore, the state pays for these infrastructures to be implemented. As well as that, it is very easy to be financed in a business like this because you get sponsored by companies that want to show that they are against the usage of hydrocarbons. The state is also encouraging you through various programs to use a non pollutant technology, zero emission cars being desired more and more. As an example, if today I want to buy an electrical car, our state will finance a part of its purchase, 10,000 euros, respectively, and once you have the electrical car, you won't have to pay taxes for it in comparison to a regular car. On another approach, our company should propose a ONU Resolution in which we ask for the implementation by law of electrical cars for everthing that means common transport and taxi cabs. The concept should be accomplished be 2025.</p>

For instance, if there wouldn't have been gas stations, people wouldn't have had where to feed their cars with gasoline. The same principles are applied for this idea: the first one to exist should be the electrical charging station, so that citizens would have where to charge them.</p></div>

  <h2 class="minfoo" id="moreinfo"> More info</h2>
  <div class=" more-info"><p> Electric taxis and public transportation will have a great impact in reducing carbon emissions, These types of vehicles are driven far more than personal-use vehicles, so commmercial and public EV fleet development should be encouraged. That's why, as a main plan that we want to initiate, we also want to develop a program with the City's Capital Hall, where it will financially sustain the buy of Tesla cars for the replacement of taxi cabs, offering the taxis' companies the opportunity of being exempted from paying the taxes if they are to buy Tesla cars. As previously mentioned, the program will be co-financed by our City Hall which will pay a specific percentage of the purchase cost, the taxi company paying the difference. As an example for this idea we have the Netherlands whose state 100% financed the investment regarding the change from regular taxi cabs, to electrical Tesla ones.</p></div>
  <div class="plans"><p> As for a succeeding plan, Romania should propose to Elon Musk to build his Europe Giga Factory here, because Romania does not ask for any construction taxes being, furthermore, a highly resourceful country in various energy branches (solar, electrical, wind power, and hydropower).</p></div>

<h5 class="questions">1. How would you convince the ones in your society to convert to this cleaner lifestyle?</h5>
<p class="pquestions"> "People are constantly talking about saving <em>our</em> planet in several ways. However, they seem to be forgetting about the major pollutant: hydrocarbons. That being said, citizens have to be reminded about this significant issue and that's how they will understand the necessity for EV's."  </p>
<h5 class="questions">2. How would you feel about having a car which you won't have to pay anually taxes for?</h5>
<p class="pquestions"> "It will be so much easier to save money if I had an electric vehicle. Unfortunately, our country doesn't posses the needed infrastructure where we could charge our possible cars. However, I believe we will have to resist a bit more time and hope that the bright future is starting tomorrow!"</p>
<h5 class="questions">3. How essential do you think it is to start implementing electrical charging stations in Romania?</h5>
<p class="pquestions"> "The fact that Romania is extremely resourceful in both electrical and solar energy, it will be very easy to have those stations implemented. As well as that, Romania will eventually have to make this switch to a healthier, non pollutant lifestyle."</p>
