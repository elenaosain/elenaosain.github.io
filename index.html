       <p id="text"><strong>The world is changing quickly,</strong> and what looked like a science-fiction fantasy is gradually becoming our <em>current reality.</em></p>

   <h2 class="warning"> Why?</h2>
   <ol>
      <li> Durability</li></a>
     <li> Safety</li></a>
     <li> Cost</li></a>
     <p> Safety is another reason why electric cars are more preferable. There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. So, according to the statistics, electric cars are saferâ€”at least in terms of flaring up.</p>
     <p>The maintenance cost of electric cars is lower than the one of those fueled by conventional gasoline. Fuel prices heavily depend on the political and military situation in countries providing oil;  one year of driving a gasoline car would cost you about $2,100 (given you drive about 15,000 miles per year, use one gallon of gas for each 25 miles traveled, and buy gasoline at $3.50 per gallon). At the same time, driving an electric car would cost you only $475 per year. Along with the fuel costs, conventional cars require regular technical inspections or transmission repairs. By all means, electric cars are a much cheaper alternative for those who want to save money.</p>

         <p>  it's extremely costly to have a car, nowadays, because there's always a part that's not working well and you have to take it to the service;  </p>

   <h2 class="how"> How?</h2>
   <p>governmental participation; the state gives you money in order to encourage you, as a citizen, to convert to a cleaner, not polluting energy; the state therefore pays for these infrastructures to be implemented; it's very easy to be financed in a business like this because you get sponsored by companies that want to show that they are against the usage of hydrocarbons; the state is also encouraging you through various programs to use a non pollutant technology; (we want to develop a program with the capital city's hall, where it will financially sustain the buy of Tesla cars-EV's- for the replacement of taxi cabs-just like in the Netherlands, Amsterdam- offering the taxis' companies the opportunity of being exempted from paying the taxes if they are to buy Tesla cars, this program being co-financed by our city hall- where they have to pay 60% or 70% of the purchase cost, the tazi company paying the differnece,as a main plan that we want to initiate); if today I want to buy an electrical car, our state will finance a part of its purchase; you don't pay taxes for the EV's in comparison to a regular car</p>

    <p> it's an idea for the future; these charging stations determine the citizens to buy electrical vehicals (if there wouldn't have been gas stations, we wouldn't have had what to do with our cars); the same principals are applied for this idea( the 1st one to exist should be the electrical charging station, so that people could get a car)</p>
